# COVID Curves

Scripts to monitor the evolution of COVID-19 propagation for each countries, based on data aggregated by the Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).


### Prerequisites
Scripts were developped with Python 3.6.8, matplotlib 2.2.2, pandas 0.25.3 and scipy 1.2.0

### Getting Started
The two main scripts are:

1/ plotCorrelation.py
-> Plot the usual observables (confirmed cases, deaths, active cases) versus time. The observables can be show in the form of cumulated, daily value (gradient) or daily value variation (curvature)
-> Curves can be smoothed with the Savitzky-Golay filter
-> Exponential extrapolation is proposed based on data before and after lockdown, if lockdown date is given.

2/ phase_diagram.py
-> plot the phase diagram of the usual observables. X-axis is the gradient (=new case/day) and Y-axis is the curvature (=variation of new case/day). The course of the epidemic can be well visualized in this phase diagram.
